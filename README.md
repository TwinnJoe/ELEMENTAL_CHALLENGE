# Elemental_Challenge

The objective of this assignment is to convert a Visio design into a fully responsive HTML and CSS layout, without relying on Bootstrap or any frontend frameworks.

This task is designed to assess my proficiency in orchestrating HTML elements harmoniously and manipulating them to ensure mobile and tablet responsiveness.

In addition to the HTML and CSS work, I was tasked with implementing slider functionality using Javascript and jQuery, without the use of third party slider plugins.
